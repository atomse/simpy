1. Frequency calculation to determine the imaginary frequency.
    VASP frequency calculation
    ENCUT = 200
    EDIFF = 1E-06
    IBRION = 5
    NFREE = 1
2. Check the vibration mode of the i-frequency.
    imagefreq.py 
    freqmov.pl POSCAR freq23 freq24  30 0.6
3. Prepare Modecar file
    modemake.py freq24
4. Do the dimer calculation
    IBRION = 3
    POTIM = 0
    ICHAIN = 2
    DdR = 0.005
    DRotMax = 10
    DFNMin = 0.01
    DFNMax = 1.0
5. Check the DIMCAR file
